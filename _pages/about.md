I am an undergraduate student at the School of Artificial Intelligence at South China Normal University. My research interests focus on large language models (LLMs), multimodal large language models (MM-LLMs), and diffusion models.

[**Code**]([https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=zh-CN&user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ&citation_for_view=DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC](https://github.com/JayYang133/ESCFD)) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- We propose a novel and efficient single-cell RNA sequencing flow diffusion (ESCFD) method based on a diffusion model, which can synthesize large-scale high-quality scRNA-seq samples within a single framework and generate ‚Äúholistic‚Äù or specific cell subpopulations.
